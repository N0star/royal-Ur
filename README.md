# The Royal Game of Ur

Enough said, the program is simply a computer implementation of this ancient board game.

## How to play?

- The game for two players. 
- Each player's goal is to dispose all of their pieces by making them go throughout the full path on a board. 
- Each turn starts with dice throw and ends with selecting a piece which then moves given number of fields forward. 
- If dice returns 0 or any given number is impossible to perform, the turn is lost. 
- To finish the path, the piece must end up exactly one step beyond the last field. 
- Players cannot put two of their pieces in one field, 
- They can however put their piece when an enemy is standing, taking enemy's piece out of the board and forcing them to start over with said piece. 
- The fields with stars are special, they give an extra turn whenever activated. 
- In addition the field in the center also gives immunity to be taken out, the enemy still can go for this field, but their piece will end up on the next one.
